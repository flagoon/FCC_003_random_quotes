# FCC_003_random_quotes
Files for FFC challenge: random quote machine. 
I used $.getJSON command on my local files. Now I'm trying to put all files on github, so I can link them to codepen. 

quotes.json is taken from someone else from github. It's some strange format. I suspected that JSON looks just like normal JS object, but this one looks like normal array... I'm not sure :)
